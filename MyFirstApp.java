Below are the declaration statements for each variable type:
* int MyNum; or int MyNum = 0;
* byte MyNum; or byte MyNum = 0;
* short MyVal; or short MyVal = 0;
* long MyVariable; long MyVariable = 0L;
* float MyVariable; or long MyVariable = 0.0f;
* double MyVariable; or double MyVariable = 0.0d;
* String MyVariable; or String MyVariable = null;
* char MyVariable; char MyVariable = "F";
* Boolen MyVariable; or Boolean MyVariable = false

* ARITHMETIC OPERATOR
* Additive operator (+)
* Subtractive operator (-)
* Multiplicative operator (*)
* Divisive operator (/) Returns the quotient of two values
* Remainder operator (%)  This returns the remainder of two values being divided

* INCREMENT OR DECREMENT OPERATORS
* These operators increase or decrease a value of a variable by 1
* (++)   Increases the value by 1 e.g ++Count increases Count by 1
* (--) - Decreases the value by 1

LOGICAL OPERATORS
* Is equal to (==)        - This checks if two values are equal
* Is Not equal to (!=)    - Checks if two values are not equal
* Is greater than (>)
* Is less than (<)
* Is greater than or equal to (>=)
* Is less than or equal to (<=)
* Logical AND (&&) -This is used to check if two values are both true.
* Logical OR (||) - Checks if at least one of the values is true.
